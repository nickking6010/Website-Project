            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Nicholas King. I've been interested in coding and programming for a while now. This mostly stems from my love of video games, and I hope to be able to make my own games as a hobby one day.</p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Starting out in High School, I took two years of Engineering classes and knew I was meant to do something in technology. After doing my general studies in college, I took a class there that taught Python. I passed this class with higher than a 100% and from that point on, Python was my favorite programming language.</p>
            <p>While finishing up college, I was recommended a program in Saint Louis called LaunchCode, which promised job-ready programming skills. I applied there for LCL101 to learn more Python. This was around the time that covid-19 was around for a while, so I ended up taking LaunchCode's Pilot Independant LCL101 course. There I learned how to program in JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, and more. It was difficult teaching myself everything with just a textbook, but I managed to pass the entire class.</p>
            <p>In my free time of the summer of 2020, I tried my hand at making video games. During this time, I self taught myself C#. Its my weakest language, but I know the basic syntax nonetheless.</p>
