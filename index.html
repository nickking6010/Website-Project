            <p>Hi there. I made this website as a way to showcase my skills as a beginner level coder and programmer. Not only that, but I've spread out details from my various studies as well. Feel free to click the other tabs to learn more about me, while also seeing what I've learned in many different programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.</p>
